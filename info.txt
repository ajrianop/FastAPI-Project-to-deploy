Step by step

In order to create our project, we create the virtual environment

1. Creating the virtual environment
    python -m venv venv

2. To start the virtual environmen use:
    venv/Scripts/activate

2*. To activate the virtual environment in Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate

3. To work with FastAPI:
    pip install fastapi

4. To work with uvicorn:
    pip install uvicorn

5. To open the application  (uvicorn NAME_OF_THE_APP:app):
    uvicorn main:app

To reload the application after changes, we can use the following
    uvicorn main:app --reload

To change the port to initalize the application:
    uvicorn main:app --reload --port 4000

To be able to open the app from other device in the same network where we are work:
    uvicorn main:app --reload --port 4000 --host 0.0.0.0

6. To see the documentation in the web bowser write the path and /docs.
    http://127.0.0.1:4000/docs

7. Methods to consider with FastAPI:

    POST create a new resource.
    PUT modify an existing resource.
    GET consult the resource.
    DELETE eliminate the existing resource.


. Intall sqlalquemy
    pip install sqlalchemy

8. The use of the pydantic library is beneficial for generating data schemas to streamline various processes with the API.
